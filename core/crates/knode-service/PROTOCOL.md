# Knode Service protocol

Knode Service is the one process that opens `.knode` spaces. The Knode app, the `knode` CLI, the
MCP server and capture all talk to it, so a person and several agents can write to the same space
at the same time and everyone sees each change as it happens.

This document describes the protocol version that ships with Knode v0.1. Rust programs can use
`knode_service::Client` instead of speaking it by hand.

## Transport

- **Socket:** a Unix domain socket at `$KNODE_HOME/service.sock`, readable and writable only by its
  owner (mode `0600`).
- **Knode home:** the `KNODE_HOME` environment variable; else `~/Library/Application Support/Knode`
  on macOS; else `$XDG_DATA_HOME/knode` (by default `~/.local/share/knode`).
- **Framing:** [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification), one JSON message per line,
  UTF-8, each line ended by `\n`. Blank lines are ignored. A line may be at most 16 MiB; a longer
  one closes the connection.
- **Order:** the requests of one connection run one after another, in the order they arrive, and
  their answers come back in the same order. Open more connections to run requests side by side.
- **Batches** (JSON arrays) are not supported: send one request per line.
- **Notifications from the client** (requests without an `id`) run, but get no answer.

## One writer

Only Knode Service opens a space. Inside it, each open space is used by one request at a time:
writes to a space never interleave, and every write is one SQLite transaction. Reads see every
write that answered before them.

Only one service runs per Knode home. The running service holds an exclusive lock on
`$KNODE_HOME/service.lock`, which also holds its process id. A second service fails to start
with "Knode Service is already running". The lock is released when the process ends, however it
ends, and a socket file left by a service that crashed is removed by the next one.

The service stops cleanly on `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`: it stops accepting connections, removes the
socket, lets writes in progress finish, closes the spaces and releases the lock.

## Requests

Every method that works on a space takes `space`: the **absolute** path of the `.knode` package.
The service opens a space the first time it is named and keeps it open. Paths are compared after
resolving symbolic links; the path the service uses is returned by `space.open` and appears in
`changed` notifications.

Every write takes `by`, the provenance of the change:

```json
{ "kind": "person", "actor": "Ada" }
{ "kind": "agent", "actor": "claude-code", "session": "8f14e45f", "source": "~/code/app" }
```

`kind` is `person`, `agent` or `system`; `session` and `source` are optional.

Node ids are [ULIDs](https://github.com/ulid/spec). Timestamps are milliseconds since the Unix
epoch, in UTC. The shapes of nodes, links, history entries and search hits are those of the
[.knode specification](https://github.com/knodemd/format).

### Example

```json
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"node.create","params":{"space":"/Users/ada/Knode/Personal.knode","title":"Plan","body":"Ship v0.1.","by":{"kind":"person","actor":"Ada"}}}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"id":"01K83N6V4W5D2XQJ0Y7RZ9T1AB","kind":"note","title":"Plan","body":"Ship v0.1.","tags":[],"created_at":1792489800123,"updated_at":1792489800123,"created_by":{"kind":"person","actor":"Ada"},"updated_by":{"kind":"person","actor":"Ada"}}}
```

### Methods

| Method | Params | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `space.create` | `space`, `name` | Space info. `space` must end in `.knode` and must not exist. |
| `space.open` | `space` | Space info. |
| `node.create` | `space`, `title`, `body`?, `kind`? (default `note`), `tags`?, `by` | The node. |
| `node.get` | `space`, `id` | The node, or `null` when no node has this id. |
| `node.find_by_title` | `space`, `title` | Node summaries with this title, oldest first. Titles are compared without regard to case or extra spaces; a `[[link]]` with this title points at the first one. |
| `node.update` | `space`, `id`, `title`?, `body`?, `kind`?, `tags`?, `by` | The node as it is now. Fields left out stay as they are. |
| `node.delete` | `space`, `id`, `by` | `null`. |
| `link.create` | `space`, `from`, `to`, `kind`? (default `related`), `by` | The link. |
| `link.delete` | `space`, `from`, `to`, `kind`? (default `related`) | `true` if there was such a link. |
| `links.from` | `space`, `id` | The links that start from the node. |
| `links.back` | `space`, `id` | The links that point at the node. |
| `links.unresolved` | `space`, `id` | The `[[links]]` in the node's text that name no node yet, as written. |
| `search` | `space`, `query`, `limit`? (default 20, at most 1000) | Search hits, best first. |
| `recent` | `space`, `limit`? (default 20, at most 1000) | Node summaries, newest change first. |
| `history` | `space`, `id` | Every version of the node, oldest first. |
| `subscribe` | `space`? | `true`. Starts `changed` notifications; see below. |
| `unsubscribe` | none | `true`. Stops them. |
| `service.status` | none | `{ "version", "pid", "spaces", "clients" }`. |

Space info is:

```json
{ "path": "/Users/ada/Knode/Personal.knode", "id": "01K83N6V4W5D2XQJ0Y7RZ9T1AB", "name": "Personal",
  "format": 0, "created_at": "2026-10-20T09:30:00.000Z", "nodes": 42 }
```

## Changes

After `subscribe`, the connection receives a `changed` notification after each write, in the
order the writes were made:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"changed","params":{"space":"/Users/ada/Knode/Personal.knode","node_id":"01K83N6V4W5D2XQJ0Y7RZ9T1AB","op":"update"}}
```

- `subscribe` with `space` adds that space; without `space`, the connection hears about every
  space. Every change made after the answer to `subscribe` is delivered.
- `op` is `create`, `update`, `delete`, `link` (a link from `node_id` was made) or `unlink` (one
  was removed). Renaming a node also sends `update` for each node whose `[[links]]` were rewritten
  to the new title.
- A write that changes nothing sends nothing.
- A connection that falls more than 1024 changes behind receives
  `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"lagged","params":{"missed":12}}` and should reload what it shows.

## Errors

Errors are JSON-RPC error objects. `message` is written for people; `data.kind` is a stable name to
match on.

| Code | `data.kind` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -32700 | | The line is not valid JSON. The answer has `"id": null`. |
| -32600 | | Not a valid JSON-RPC 2.0 request, or a batch. |
| -32601 | | No method has this name. |
| -32602 | `invalid_params` | Params missing or of the wrong type, a bad node id, or a relative `space` path. |
| -32603 | | Something went wrong inside the service, or it is stopping. |
| -32001 | `not_found` | No node has this id. |
| -32002 | `not_a_space` | The path is not a `.knode` package. |
| -32003 | `already_exists` | A space already exists at this path. |
| -32004 | `invalid` | A value breaks a rule of the format, such as an empty title or a bad kind. |
| -32005 | `unsupported` | The space was written by a newer version of Knode, or its files do not agree. |
| -32006 | `storage` | The files of the space could not be read or written. |

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":7,"error":{"code":-32001,"message":"node 01K83N6V4W5D2XQJ0Y7RZ9T1AB not found","data":{"kind":"not_found"}}}
```

## Starting the service

- `knode service run` runs it in the foreground.
- The `knode` CLI starts it in the background when it is not running.
- On macOS a launch agent, `~/Library/LaunchAgents/md.knode.service.plist`, starts it at login and
  keeps it running. On Linux a systemd user unit, `knode.service`, does the same.
